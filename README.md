# Udacity FEND Classic Arcade Game

This is my Udacity Nano-degree project to re-create a classic arcade game (Frogger) using Javascript.

## Getting Started

Just Git Clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser and the game will run.

## Game play

Your character will start at the bottom of the board.  The objective is to successfully cross the street without getting hot by one of the bugs.  If you do get hit by one of the bugs you will go back to the beginning.  Use your arrow keys to move your character.  You can go up, down, left, and right.  If you successfully cross the road you can rest and bask in your success.  If you want you can go up one more time and start the challenge over.  Good luck!  Have fun!

### Prerequisites

A Javascript compatible web browser.
